Trillo project is based on the Jonas Schmedtmann "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!" course from Udemy. 

It's ment to show the correct usage of flex-box, animations, transitions, Sass and CSS variables and sprite. 
Also I added ReactJS (not included in the original course).

Notes: 

- Sprite only works on web services. 
- Flex-box is partially supported by IE version 10 and 11, and not supported by version 6 to 9.
